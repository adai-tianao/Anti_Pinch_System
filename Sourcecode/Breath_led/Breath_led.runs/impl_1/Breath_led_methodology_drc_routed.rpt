TIMING-16#1 Warning
Large setup violation  
There is a large setup violation of -5.930 ns between u_pwm/mode_reg[0]/C (clocked by SYSCLK) and u_pwm/T_UP_reg[15]/D (clocked by SYSCLK). Large setup violations at the end of those stages might be difficult to fix during the post-placement implementation flow and could be the result of non-optimal XDC constraints or non-optimal design architecture
Related violations: <none>
